Package for exporting all schema data and content from an Umbraco project using an API endpoint.

The package is installed in your source project, where you keep your baseline schema data. It exposes an endpoint (`/umbraco/schemex/export/get`) that returns a `package.xml` file containing all Content Types, Media Types, Data Types, Stylesheets, Templates, Dictionary Items, and the first content node and its descendants.

You can then install the [Importer package of Schemex](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Umbraco.Community.Schemex.Importer/) in your source project, and use that to import the schema from your source project to a new project.

The file generated by the exporter package can also either be used in a [starter kit package](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/extending/packages#starter-kits) made for Umbraco, or imported with a package like [Dragonfly Schema Importer](https://dragonflylibraries.com/umbraco-packages/schema-importer/).

Note. This package essentially exposes all of your schema data publicly. Don't install this package on a sensitive Umbraco project, or make sure to delete it, once you don't need it anymore!
